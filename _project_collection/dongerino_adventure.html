lead: A 2D turn-based strategy game developed using Java and Lightweight Java Game Library.
description: This game was made as the final project for my high school computer science course. I implemented the game logic, including unit interactions, action tracking, item system, and win/lose condition checking. In addition, I was also reponsible for the AI, which employed some concepts from game theories, such as Minimax.
