name: Scala Compiler
lead: A compiler written in Scala, which compiled a subset of Scala into MIPS.
description: 'For my CS241e - Enriched Foundations of Sequential Programs course, I built a compiler that parsed a subset of Scala all the way down to MIPS assembly instructions. The compiler consisted of multiple parts, including:'
order: 4

<ul>
  <li>
    A simple semispace garbage collector which implemented Cheney's algorithm.
  </li>
  <li>
    A typer which performed type inference and validation.
  </li>
  <li>
    A parser using Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm that created a parse tree given the input tokens and the grammar.
  </li>
  <li>
    A maximal munch scanner which parsed input into tokens given a deterministic finite automaton.
  </li>
  <li>
    An assembler which transformed abstractions such as closures, control structures, variables, and expressions into machine code.
  </li>
</ul>
