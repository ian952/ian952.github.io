name: Software Defect Predictor
lead: Using machine learning to predict possible defects in software patches.
description: 'For my SE465 - Software Testing, Quality Assurance, and Maintenance project, I used the WEKA machine learning library in Java to train a model that can predict the likelihood of a defect for a patch given the code change and metadata. Code changes are parsed into a bag-of-words model and used to train the model along with other metadata such as the number of files changed, and the time of submission. To achieve the best results, various models, such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Alternating Decision Tree, were experimented with as well.'
