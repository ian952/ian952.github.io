name: Tetromino Simulator
github: https://github.com/ian952/Tetris
lead: A Tetris game developed using Processing, a variation of Java, controlled using the TI Launchpad microcontroller.
description: This project was created as the final project for my SE101, Introduction to Methods of Software Engineering, course. The game logic is written in Java and played on a computer, while the TI Launchpad microcontroller is responsible for reading user inputs as well as showing the next block on its LCD display. I wrote most of the game logic as well as the serial communication protocol between the computer and the microcontroller.
order: 3
