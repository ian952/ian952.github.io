			<p>This game was made as the final project for my high school computer science course. I implemented the game logic, including unit interactions, action tracking, item system, and win/lose condition checking. In addition, I was also reponsible for the AI, which employed some concepts from game theories, such as Minimax.</p>

			<p>This project was created as the final project for my SE101 course. The game logic is written in Java and played on a computer, while the TI Launchpad microcontroller is responsible for reading user inputs as well as showing the next block on its LCD display. I wrote most of the game logic as well as the serial communication protocol between the computer and the microcontroller.</p>
