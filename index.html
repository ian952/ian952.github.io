          Welcome to my website! I am an aspiring software engineer with interests in web development, software design, and algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my last winter work term, I was at Remind in San Francisco as a software engineering intern and worked with mostly Ruby on Rails and React. While I am on my study term, I also work part-time as a web developer for Ivy Global remotely.

          I first started programming in high school and the first language I ever learned was <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)">Turing</a>. Because it was really easy to create graphics, I used it for my very first project, which was a matching game. Later on, I learned some Java and made a few more games, such as <a href="projects#oniregnod-adventure">Oniregnod Adventure</a>.
        </p>

          My passion for programming really began when I started participating in competitive programming. I enjoyed the challenge to find the simplest and fastest way to solve complex problems. In doing so, I had to learn many things on my own, such as C++, algorithms, runtime complexity and data structures. Some of my achievements include a bronze medal in the Canadian Computing Olympiad, and top finishes in the Canadian Computing Competition.
