        I am a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I enjoy solving difficult problems and participating in contests. In high school, I self-taught C++ using internet resources and used it to write various programming contests. I was ranked top 20 in Canada in the Canadian Computing Competition and received Bronze Medal in the Canadian Computing Olympiad. The thrill of solving a difficult problem motivates and drives me to take on more challenging and ambitious tasks. In my free time, I enjoy playing the Saxophone (mostly Jazz), watching Netflix, and playing League of Legends.
