          Welcome to my website! I am an aspiring software engineer with interests in web development, software design, and algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          For fall of 2017, I interned on the merchant platform team at Wish  and worked with a Python backend and Javascript frontend. I was an intern at Remind for the winter of 2017, where I worked with Ruby on Rails and React. I have also worked at Ivy Global as an intern in the summer of 2016 and also as a part time developer for 8 month.

          I first started programming in high school and the first language I ever learned was <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)">Turing</a>. Because it was really easy to create graphics, I used it for my very first project, which was a matching game. Later on, I learned some Java and made a few more games, such as <a href="projects#oniregnod-adventure">Oniregnod Adventure</a>.

          My passion for programming really began when I started participating in competitive programming. I enjoyed the challenge to find the simplest and fastest way to solve complex problems. In doing so, I had to learn many things on my own, such as C++, algorithms, runtime complexity and data structures. Some of my achievements include a bronze medal in the Canadian Computing Olympiad, and top finishes in the Canadian Computing Competition.
