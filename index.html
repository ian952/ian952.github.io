      Welcome to my website! I am an aspiring software engineer with interests in distributed systems, networking, and
      algorithms.

      I am currently in my fourth year of university and I have worked at

      I first started programming in high school and the first language I ever learned was
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)">Turing</a>. Because it was
      really easy to create graphics in Turing, I used it for my very first project, which was a matching game. Later
      on, I learned some Java and used it to make a few more games, such as
      <a href="projects#oniregnod-adventure">Oniregnod Adventure</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      My passion for programming really began when I learned about the world of competitive programming. I enjoyed the
      challenge of finding the simplest and fastest way to solve complex problems. In doing so, I had to learn many
      things on my own, such as C++, and algorithms & data structures. Some of my achievements include a bronze medal in
      the Canadian Computing Olympiad, and top finishes in the Canadian Computing Competition.
