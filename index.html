          Welcome to my website! I am an aspiring software engineer with interests in web development, distributed systems, and algorithms.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          I am currently in my third year of university and I have worked at Google, Wish, Remind, and Ivy Global. Some of the languages I have experience with include Python, JavaScript, Objective-C, Java, and Ruby.

          I first started programming in high school and the first language I ever learned was <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)">Turing</a>. Because it was really easy to create graphics in Turing, I used it for my very first project, which was a matching game. Later on, I learned some Java and used it to make a few more games, such as <a href="projects#oniregnod-adventure">Oniregnod Adventure</a>.

          My passion for programming really began when I learned about the world of competitive programming. I enjoyed the challenge of finding the simplest and fastest way to solve complex problems. In doing so, I had to learn many things on my own, such as C++, and algorithms & data structures. Some of my achievements include a bronze medal in the Canadian Computing Olympiad, and top finishes in the Canadian Computing Competition.
